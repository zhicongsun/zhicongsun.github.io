</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iii) the semi-formal representation of S&amp;S requirements;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iv) the methodology for identifying contradictions in S&amp;S requirements;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(v) the solution of S&amp;S contradictions.

<h2>Dealing with Security and Safety (S&amp;S) Contradictions for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>
<p><i>Main Researcher</i> | SUSTech, Sept 2021 - Present<br />
Advisors: <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangsh/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang</a> and <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/dingyl/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Yulong Ding</a>.<br />
Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Number: 61873119 and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Safety and Security for Next Generation of Industrial Internet.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Goal:</u> to propose a systematic methodology for identifying the contradictions in S&amp;S requirements and provide strategies to reduce such contradictions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Contributions:</u> 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(i) an iCPSs conceptual model is proposed and some widely recognized S&amp;S objectives are adopted and redefined to constrain the objects and interactions in the model; 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(ii) a causes-phenomena-effects analysis (CPEA) method is proposed to unify the elicitation of S&amp;S requirements; 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iii) a requirement template with constricted natural language patterns is designed for expressing both safety and security requirements; 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iv) the concept of contradictions in S&amp;S requirements is defined, and two sufficient conditions that result in contradictions are proposed; further, algorithms are provided to judge whether these conditions are satisfied or not.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><u>Academic achievement:</u> finished a 21-page paper which is under review by <b>IEEE IoT-J</b>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Application achievement:</u> this work has been recognized by Huawei Trustworthy Intelligent Systems Laboratory and the SUSTech academic council, and it will be used in <b>Huawei's self-driving automobile</b>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Future directions:</u> to propose a methodology for reducing S&amp;S contradictions.

<h2>Joint Safety and Security Risk Analysis in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (iCPSs)</h2>
<p><i>Main Researcher</i> | SUSTech, Sept 2021 - Present<br />
Advisors: <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangsh/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang</a> and <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/dingyl/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Yulong Ding</a>.<br />
Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Number: 61873119 and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Safety and Security for Next Generation of Industrial Internet.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Goal:</u> to identify the limitations in the field of joint safety and security risk analysis, so as to provide research directions in future work.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Contributions:</u> 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(i) made a more detailed classification of four kinds of interactions between safety and security (i.e., independence, conditional dependence, mutual reinforcement, and antagonism) and maps relevant methods to these relationships; 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(ii) focused on the methodologies for safety and security joint risk analysis and discussed their advantages and shortcomings; 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iii) proposed twelve criteria to evaluate reviewed approaches and made a preliminary discussion about whether these methods meet the requirements of iCPS.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><u>Academic achievement:</u> proposed six research directions; finished a 24-page review article that is under review by <b>IEEE IoT-J</b>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>One of the future directions:</u> to propose a data-driven risk assessment method that does not use subjective experience for initial modeling and can meet the dynamic configuration characteristics of the system.
