<h2>Identification and Resolution of Contradictions between Safety and Security (S&amp;S) in Intelligent Connected Vehicle (ICV)</h2>
<p><i>Main Researcher</i> | SUSTech, Sept 2022 - Present<br />
Advisors: <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangsh/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang</a> and <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/dingyl/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Yulong Ding</a>.<br />
Supported by Huawei Trustworthy Intelligent Systems Laboratory.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Goal: to identify and reduce the contradiction in S&amp;S requirements for ICV, satisfying high accuracy and efficiency in the coordination of safety and security in ICV.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Current achievements: investigated the literature and formulated a detailed research proposal. The research focuses on five parts: the system model of ICV, the unified elicitation of S&amp;S requirements, the semi-formal representation of S&amp;S requirements, the methodology for identifying contradictions in S&amp;S requirements, and the solution of S&amp;S contradictions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dealing with Security and Safety (S&amp;S) Contradictions for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>
<p><i>Main Researcher</i> | SUSTech, Sept 2021 - Present<br />
Advisors: <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangsh/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang</a> and <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/dingyl/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Yulong Ding</a>.<br />
Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Number: 61873119 and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Safety and Security for Next Generation of Industrial Internet.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Goal: to propose a systematic methodology for identifying the contradictions in S&amp;S requirements and provide strategies to reduce such contradictions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Current achievements: completed two articles as the first author and submitted them to the IEEE Internet of things Journal (both are under review), including one review article (24 pages, submitted on 05-May-2022) and one regular article about contradictions detection (21 pages, submitted on 26-Jul-2022).

<h2>Direction Estimation of Ionospheric Echo based on High-Frequency Ground Wave Radar</h2>
<p><i>Main Researcher</i> | HIT, Jan 2020 - May 2020<br />
Advisor: <a href="http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/yuchangjun?lang=en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Changjun Yu</a>.<br />
Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Number: 61971159 and Institute of Electronic Engineering Technology, HIT.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Goal: High-frequency ground wave radar can detect and track targets beyond the line of sight. However, the ionospheric echo has a negative impact on the detection of the target since its large intensity and wide coverage area. This work aims to estimate the azimuth and elevation of ionospheric echo, so as to provide a basis for the suppression of ionospheric clutter in future work.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Actions: analyzed the signal and modeled the array flow pattern of the two-dimensional receiving antenna; compared the effects of different array parameters and criteria on digital beamforming; compared the convergence performance of different adaptive weight vector adjustment algorithms; compared two kinds of DOA estimation algorithms, including beam-scanning-based methods and super-resolution estimation methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Achievements: reduced the time complexity of the algorithm for beam-scanning-based angle measurement from O(n^2) to O(n); got 95 points in the graduation project review, ranking second in my major; appraised as excellent graduation design of the HIT. <a href="https://github.com/zhicongsun/Estimation-of-ionospheric-echo-direction-of-HF-surface-wave-radar" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[repository]</a>
